### Title {.no-title}

**Welcome to my dashboard!** This is where I am building my work for the EDLD 652 Data Visualization Final Project. I hope you enjoy coding as mush as do!\

The dataset used in this project is from the **International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) Teacher Panel 2020**, retrieved from the **International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)**. ICILS investigates how teachers integrate technology into their teaching practices across different educational systems: Finland, Denmark, and Uruguay.\

For more details about the study and its findings, visit: [Data](https://www.iea.nl/data-tools/repository/icils), [ICILS](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/), [Report: Changes in Digital Learning During a Pandemic—Findings From the ICILS](https://www.iea.nl/publications/study-reports/international-reports-iea-studies/changes-digital-learning-during)\

In this project, I explored how teachers ICT use frequency in relate with school's attitude toward technology and the disciplines. 

**Research Question One**

What is the relationship between teacher’s information and communication technology (ICT) use frequency with their school’s attitude toward using ICT technology in the classroom? (This question is aiming to explore institutional attitude toward ICT influence individual teacher behavior in adopting technology for teaching).\

**Research Question Two**

What is the relationship between teachers’ technology use in the classroom and their major teaching subjects? This question aims to explore whether teachers in different subject areas (e.g., mathematics, sciences, language arts) use technology more frequently  compare to their peers in other subjects).

**Visualization #1**

This section shows a table of descriptive statistics of the subset dataset for Research Question One. The primary audience for this visualization includes school administrators and professional development designers. The goal is to communicate how a school's stance on ICT affects teacher’s usage of technology in their classroom. By highlighting these relationships, I aim to identify gaps in teacher readiness and perceptions that professional development programs can address.

### Version 1

```{r warning=FALSE}
datasummary_skim(rq1_data, 
                 type = "categorical")
```

> Here is the first try via `datasummary_skim function` from the `modelsummary` package. Considering the nature of our subset data, it doesn't show much details about teacher participant in the year of 2018 and 2020 respectively. 

### Version 2

```{r}
rq1_summary <- rq1_data %>% 
  datasummary_skim(type = "categorical", output = "gt") %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Summary of Teachers' ICT Perspectives (2018 & 2020)"
  ) %>% 
  cols_width(everything() ~ pct(50)) %>% 
  opt_table_font(size = 10)

```

> At here, I added `output = "gt"` to apply functions from the `gt package` within `datasummary_skim`. Surprisingly, it worked! `gt package` gives me flexibility to customize my table. However, this version of summary table looks still robust.\

### Version 3

```{r warning=FALSE}
rq1_summary <- rq1_data %>% 
  group_by(cntry, year, it2g06a, it2g14a) %>% 
  summarise(
    N = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(Percent = round(100 * N/sum(N), 1)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = c(N, Percent), names_glue = "{year}_{.value}") %>% 
  arrange(cntry, it2g06a, it2g14a)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
rq1_summary %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Teachers' ICT perspectives by country and year (2018 & 2020)") %>% 
  cols_label(
    cntry = "Country",
    it2g06a = "ICT Use Frequency",
    it2g14a = "School ICT Priority",
    `2018_N` = "N (2018)",
    `2018_Percent` = "% (2018)",
    `2020_N` = "N (2020)",
    `2020_Percent` = "% (2020)"
  ) %>% 
  fmt_number(columns = c(`2018_Percent`, `2020_Percent`), decimals = 1) %>%
  tab_options(table.width = pct(100),
              table.font.size = 11) %>% 
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(whitespace = "nowrap"),
    locations = cells_body(columns = c(it2g06a,it2g14a))) %>% 
  cols_width(
    it2g06a ~ pct(150),
    everything() ~ pct(150)) %>% 
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_fill(color = "#1E88E5")),
    location = list(
      cells_body(columns = everything(), rows = it2g06a == "Every day"))
  ) %>% 
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Note: DNK refers to Denmark, FIN refers to Finland, and URY refers to Uruguay.")
```

> I then decided to subgroup the dataset by country and year to show the counts and percentage for each category. To highlight the highest level of ICT use frequency in the table, I used `tab_style` and the `location` argument to map the highlights on the tabel. I also choosed a blind fridenly color in this process. This version was almost to what I need, but the whole table still needed further adjustment.

**Visualization #2**

In this section, I meant to use a plot to show any trends between school ICT priority and Teacher ICT use, as well as Teacher ICT use before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The hardest part was to construct a clean and informative plot. The primary audience for this visualization includes school administrators and professional development designers. The goal is to communicate how a school's stance on ICT affects teacher’s usage of technology in their classroom. By highlighting these relationships, I aim to identify gaps in teacher readiness and perceptions that professional development programs can address.

> In my second attempt, I adjust the position of bars and applied scale_fill_OkabeIto() to make it color-blind friendly.

### Version 3

```{r}

> I tried `coord_flip()`in this attempt mainly because the level labels on the x-axis took too much of the lower space. However, we can see all the key information mapped on this plot are either clustered or separated. The overall flow is not good. 

# ICT Use Frequency and School ICT Priority {data-icon="fa-solid fa-superscript"}

Sidebar {.sidebar}
----------------------------------------------
**Visualization #3**

Previous statistical summaries indicate that Finland has the highest proportion in schools that prioritize ICT and the highest percentage of teachers who integrate ICT into their daily routine. I would like to know if this relationship is truly significant in Finland, so in this section, I combined schools priority into two levels: "Agree" and "Disagree", and intend to use Pearson's Chi-squared test to examine the relationship between schools ICT priority with teacher ICT use frequency. 

```{r}
# data wrangling
rq1_analysis <- rq1_data %>% 
  mutate(it2g14a_recode = case_when(
    it2g14a %in% c("Strongly Agree", "Agree") ~ "Agreee",
    it2g14a %in% c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree") ~ "Disagree"
  ))

```

> We conducted a Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test with an alpha-trheshold of 0.05, and we reject our null hypothesis. In the population from which the sample for this study was drawn, we did detect statistically significant relationship, on average, between school ICT priority and their teachers ICT use frequency in Finland ($\chi^2$ = 15.655, df = 4, *p*-value = 0.0035).

```

> I applied `scale_fill_viridis_d` to ajust the color for my plot. In addition, I use `scale_y_log10` to adjust the scale of y-axis. However, the change of scale does't show the disparity between school ICT priority.

**Visualization #4**

The primary audience for this visualization includes curriculum developers and EdTech service providers. The goal of this visualization is to identify the specific needs of various subject areas. By understanding these patterns, EdTech providers can develop customized technology resources that better support teachers in different disciplines. Curriculum developers can use these insights to align instructional strategies with technological integration.
